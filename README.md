# Greetings ðŸ‘‹

I am James and I am looking to seek a career in the world of data and technology, with a focus on artificial intelligence and data science. 

Currently studying Physics and Astrophysics at university and searching for work experience. 

My GitHub profile will be a portfolio to showcase the projects I have done in these fields. 

More to come soon...
