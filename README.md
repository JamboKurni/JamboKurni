# Greetings I am James ðŸ‘‹

I am looking to seek a career in the world of data and technology, with a focus on artificial intelligence, machine learning and data science. 

Currently studying Physics and Astrophysics at university and searching for work experience and internships in these fields. 

My GitHub profile will be a portfolio to showcase the projects I have done in these fields. 

More to come soon...
